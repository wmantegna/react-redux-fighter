# Fighter!

This repo is a small project I built while learning React/Redux. Rather than doing a todo app, I settled on the idea of mashing up Street Fighter & Pokemon, using the [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) to power the logic.

**This is the react_only branch, which is a much simpler implementation than what's described in this ReadMe**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Download/clone this project, and start it with `yarn start` or `npm start`.

## Workflow

 - User selects skills (attack/defense/health) for their character.
 - Once all skill points have been allocated to skills, an oponent is generated, and a fight begins.
 - User can select to 'Attack' or 'Reflect' their opponent. the opponent does the same, and an outcome is displayed.
 - When one fighter's health reaches 0, a message displaying the winner appears.

## Dev Process
 
- **Learn React basics:** Use React to build a UI that generates random characters for the user to choose from. Once a character has been selected, select a second character for the user's character to fight.
- **Learn Redux basics:** Implement a Redux store to manage state for the React app.
- **Business logic change:** Allow a user to pick their characters stats, then present them with a randomly generated opponent.
- **Game feature:** UI components to display both fighters, buttons for user actions (attack & reflect), and to display the results from all turns taken. Also build actions/reducers/logic to power this.
- **Refactor:** use JS classes to isolate Fighter & Turn logic to simplify code.
- **Decrease fighter health based on turn outcomes:** Decrease fighter health based on turn outcomes
- **Learn redux-thunk:** Creating a turn doesn't actually update a fighter's remaining health. So we'll need to fire off two redux actions from a single user action. the **redux-thunk** library allows us to do this.
